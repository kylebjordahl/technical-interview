# Technical Inverview

Complete the functions in each challenge file so that all tests pass.
 - ✅ DO write efficient algorithms, as some tests check runtime duration
 - ✅ DO add comments to explain your thought process
 - ❌ DO NOT modify or mutate the incoming arguments
 - ❌ DO NOT import any external libraries
 
There is no need to use typescript, but feel free to use it if you like.

All work should be done directly in `challenge*.ts` files; the associated `challenge*.spec.ts` files will check your answers.

## To check your answers

```sh
npm run challenge
```

## Array Challenges
